# Excel Fun
## Some of Amy's Favourite Excel Templates

Love Excel?  Refuse to give up the program that everyone at work uses for everything?  Want to easily show your students some cool things that Excel can do?

Here are some Excel sheets that I use in my teaching, either to demonstrate to students how a concept works, or to make up for the fact that some things are lacking in Excel (I'm looking at you \chi^2 test of independence).

Enjoy!
